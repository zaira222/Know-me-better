       <h2>Hello, my name is Zaira. I am currently in the MSU Coding Bootcamp. I have done a couple of 
        projects that I will demonstrate below with links. I have used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
        I am still in the process of learning more programs to be able to work with a variety. 
        I have done three projects so far. Run Buddy is a website that I made for customers to be 
        able to reach out to the trainers from Run Buddy. Guest Engagement is another project where 
        it tries to reach out to as many customers as possible. My final project that I worked with 
        HTML and JavaScript to build a game called Robot Gladiators. The most recent project I worked
         on was a collaborative project which we created a website to that uses user input to search
          any topic that the guest wants. The guest will either choose a video tab or article tab and
           results will appear according to the guests selections.
